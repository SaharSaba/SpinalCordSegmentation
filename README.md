Automatic segmentation method (K-seg) supporting T2-weighted MR images which can work efficiently on the thoracic to lumbar levels in the spinal cord:

Spinal cord segmentation is among the first steps in the pre-processing of MRI scans for a variety of purposes. This segmentation is especially difficult due to the variety of spinal MRI contrast,
anatomy and the different fields of view. The output with similar protocols showed that K-Seg results match the manual segmentation better than the other methods particularly on the thoracolumbar
levels in the spinal cord due to the low image contrast as a result of poor SNR in these areas
